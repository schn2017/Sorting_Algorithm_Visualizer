# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer
### Description
Besides Conway's game of life, algoritm visualizers were something I always wanted to create. For this project, I decided to create/visualize the five most common sorting algorithms (Bubble sort, Insertion sort, Merge sort, Quick sort and Selection sort). Of the five sorting algorithms, merge sort and quick sort were the hardest to visualize (they were too fast for the gui to draw periodically). In order to resolve this issue, a new thread was created for each sort with delays inside those threads. These new threads and their delays made drawing the steps of the two sorting algorithms visible.

### Insertion Sort

### Merge Sort

### Quick Sort

### Selection Sort

### Randomize
